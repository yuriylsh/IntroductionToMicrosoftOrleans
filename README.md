Learning [Microsoft Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) using [Introduction to Microsoft Orleans](Introduction to Microsoft Orleans) Pluralsight course.

The course uses an old (pre-release) version of Orleans so the code here is translated to the newer (current as of time of learning) version of Orleans based on [current documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/docs/index.html)
